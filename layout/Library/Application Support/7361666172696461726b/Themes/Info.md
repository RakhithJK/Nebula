# Making themes

1. Themes should be in the /layout/Library/Application Support/7361666172696461726b/Themes/ folder in a .deb file
2. Themes are .css files, any other file extensions are ignored
3. On the first line of the file, there should be a comment with the host of the site that the theme is to be loaded on:
`/* www.host.com */` for a single host, or `/* www.host.com, www.host2.com, ...*/` for multiple.
